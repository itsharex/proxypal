# ProxyPal v0.4.34

**Released:** 2026-05-12

## Sidecar Upgrade: CLIProxyAPI v6.10.8 → v7.0.2

This release upgrades the bundled CLIProxyAPI sidecar from **v6.10.8** (built May 4, 2026) to **v7.0.2** (released May 10, 2026), jumping 4 releases including a major version bump.

### Why this matters

The bundled sidecar was 12 days stale while upstream ships daily. v7.0.2 has been battle-tested (2,677+ downloads on linux_amd64 alone) with 2 patch releases on top of v7.0.0.

### What changed in CLIProxyAPI (v6.10.9 → v7.0.2)

**Stability fixes (v6.10.9 → v7.0.2):**

- Codex WebSocket upstream disconnect handling (prevents zombie sessions)
- Amp thread actors route fix
- OpenAI → Kimi continuous function_call conversion fix
- OpenAI streaming: null usage chunks now ignored, empty responses stream repaired
- Claude OAuth refresh 429 backoff deduplication
- Gemini CLI project ID from onboarding response
- Goroutine leak prevention in streaming executors
- Antigravity cancellation error preservation

**New v7 features (available for future ProxyPal integration):**

- Remote home control plane config loading (multi-device sync potential)
- Per-auth `disable_cooling` override support
- `disabled` flag persistence in token storage (survives restarts)
- Home auth dispatch usage statistics
- Home request-log forwarding
- WebSocket session reuse for home auths with caching (v7.0.1)
- Detailed logging for home config changes (v7.0.2)

**Breaking change in v7.0.0 (no impact on ProxyPal):**

- Removed `ClaudeCodeSessionAffinity` — **ProxyPal does not reference this, zero impact verified**
